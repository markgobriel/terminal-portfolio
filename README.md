# ‚ö° Terminal-Inspired Portfolio

Welcome to my **Terminal-Inspired Portfolio**! This project is a **React + Vite** application that emulates a command-line interface, allowing visitors to explore my skills, projects, and professional links in a fun, interactive way.

## ‚ú® Overview

- **Terminal UI**: Users can type commands (e.g., `ls projects`, `cd projects`, `nano resume.pdf`) right in the browser.
- **Side-by-Side Layout**: Left panel for terminal input/output, right panel for displaying quick links (GitHub, LinkedIn, Email) or project details.
- **Creative Twist**: Encourages interaction by ‚Äúopening‚Äù links or running commands just like in a real shell environment.

## üöÄ Tech Stack

- **React** + **Vite**: Lightweight setup for a fast dev experience and smooth deployment.  
- **HTML/CSS**: Custom styling to achieve the terminal look (green prompts, dark background, monospace fonts).  
- **JavaScript**: Command parser that handles user inputs and updates the display accordingly.

## üîß Core Commands

1. **`ls projects`**  
   Displays a list of all available projects.
2. **`cd projects/<project-name>`**  
   Shows details about a specific project (description, GitHub link, etc.).
3. **`nano resume.pdf`**  
   Opens a simulated text viewer or PDF display (depending on your setup) to show your resume.
4. **`open linkedin`**  
   Redirects or displays your LinkedIn profile in the right panel or a new tab.
5. **`open github`**  
   Opens your GitHub profile link.
6. **`help`**  
   Lists all possible commands.
7. **`clear`**  
   Clears the terminal output.
8. **`exit`**  
   A playful shutdown message or end interaction.

These commands are just examples‚Äîfeel free to add or customize them as you like.

## üé® Features

- **Split-Screen Design**: The terminal is on the left side, while the right side displays dynamic info (Quick Links by default, project details on demand).  
- **Responsive Layout**: Stacks vertically on small screens for easy mobile usage.  
- **Intuitive Prompts**: Shows a welcome message and a helpful list of commands upon page load.  
- **Fun & Professional**: Blends creativity with usability so fellow techies (and non-techies!) can quickly find what they need.
